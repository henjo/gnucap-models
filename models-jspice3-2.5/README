"-" means there is a problem.

"+", "loads" means that it loads with no reported error.

"++" means passes a quick check, and looks sane.

"+++" means passes a real check, and looks sane.

"++++", "tested" means that it has been tested, with results confirmed 
against an appropriate reference.

"+++++", "supported" means that it has been tested and works correctly, and
included in multiple regressions.

In all cases, "binning" dosn't work, and handling of initial conditions
(UIC) is incomplete.


More detailed status:

"bjt" model:
Some results are different from other versions of bjt.
In one test, "op" doesn't show the same results every time,
but seems to work correctly in setting up for a following AC.
Not sure why.  Until some more testing and debugging is done,
the "models-spice3f5" version or the native version is
recommended instead.


"mos" model:

Passes all tests on level 1,2,3,6 .. standard spice models.

Level 8 (cryo-mos) appears to pass some tests, fail others.
Further study is needed.


"jj" model:

Parse problem .. a parameter is a device, not supported by
spice-wrapper.

Devices not using that parameter don't work either.
