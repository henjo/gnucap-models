The following text documents the changes in BSIM4.6.1 as compared to the previous release BSIM4.6.0:
 
1) New material model is introduced for the predictve modeling of Non-SiO2 insulator, Non-Poly Silicon gate 
   and Non-silicon channel.
 - The following new parameters are added
   MTRLMOD : New material model selector
   PHIG, EPSRGATE : non-poly silicon gate parameters
   EOT, VDDEOT : non-SiO2 gate dielectric
   EASUB, EPSRSUB, NI0SUB, BG0SUB, TBGASUB, TBGBSUB, ADOS, BDOS : Non-silicon channel parameters

2) Mobility model (MOBMOD = 0 and MOBMOD = 1) has been improved through predictive modeling of vertical electric field. 
   The improved mobility model is selected through MTRLMOD = 1 for backward compatibility.

3) GIDL/GISL models are improved through an improved definition of flatband voltages at S/D ends.
   The improved GISL/GIDL model is selected through MTRLMOD = 1 for backward compatibility.  

4) Poly-depletion model is modified to account for new gate and gate-insulator materials.

5) C-V model has been improved by adding a new VgsteffCV definition through CVCHARGEMOD = 1
 - 6 new parameters have been added
	CVCHARGEMOD, MINVCV, LMINVCV, WMINCV, PMINVCV and VOFFCVL

6) Bug fix : Following the report by Geoffery Coram (ADI),an error in the derivative calculation of dVdseffCV_dVb has been 
   fixed for CAPMOD = 1 and CAPMOD = 2 in b4ld.c

7) The warning limits for NOFF and VOFFCV have been removed from b4check.c.
