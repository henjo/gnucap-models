The revised BSIM4.2.0 code is ready on April.6, 2001. XL, XW are added. The effective channel 
length and width are described as :
         Lnew = L+ XL
         Wnew = W/NF + XW
         Leff = Lnew - 2dL
         Weff = Wnew  - 2dW
	
Users are recommended to mind the positive signs in between and give correct offset.

Bugfixes include:
RS/RD incompletion and extraneous node allocations
correction of NQS and QS mismatch
correction of CAPMOD=0 error

Now the BSIM4 code makes a better compatibility of BSIM3 netlist to that of BSIM4
and also the computation efficiency is improved.
