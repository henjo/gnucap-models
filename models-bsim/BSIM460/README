The following text documents the changes in BSIM4.6 as compared to the previous release BSIM4.5:
 
1) Implementation of independent source-side Gate Induced Source Leakage:

- Duplicate the current GIDL equation with new parameters to be
   applied to source
- Restrict the current equation to drain-side only
- Naming convention for source-side parameters:
   AGISL, BGISL, CGISL, EGISL
- Backward compatible implementation : If AGISL not given, it assumes value of AGIDL.
- Add binning parameters for source side parameters :
   (L,W,P)AGISL,(L,W,P)BGISL,(L,W,P)CGISL,(L,W,P)EGISL.


2) Correction to the Gate Edge Source Leakage model for full 
source/drain separation:

The GEDL model is only partially asymmetric, some parameters are common
to source and drain side equations.

- Current common parameters that need to be separated drain/source:
    NJTS, NJTSSW, NJTSSWG
    TNJT, TNJTSSW, TNJTSSWG
- New parameters: Add additional parameters for Drain side only
    NJTSD, NJTSSWD, NJTSSWGD
    TNJTSD, TNJTSSWD, TNJTSSWGD
- Backward compatibility implementation: If NJTSD not given, it assumes value of NJTS


3) Implementation of independent Gate Overlap source-side current:

- Separate the common gate overlap current equation into source/drain side
- Current parameters that would need to be changed
    DLCIG, AIGSD, BIGSD, CIGSD
- Add DLCIGD for drain side and retain DLCIG for source side. 
- Drain and Source side parameters
    AIGS, BIGS, CIGS, AIGD, BIGD, CIGD
- Strict backward compatibility with AGISD overwriting the parameters AIGS / AIGD
- Add the binning parameters for the new drain and source side parameters
    (L,W,P)AIGS, (L,W,P)BIGS, (L,W,P)CIGS, (L,W,P)AIGD, (L,W,P)BIGD, (L,W,P)CIGD


4) Noise Model Correction :

Following the bug report from Mentor Graphics,the accuracy of RgateMod = 2 has been improved 
by accounting correctly the contribution from Rgate to overall noise. The change has been 
made in b4noi.c


5) Mobility Model Correction : 

Following the bug report from ADI, the implementation of columb scattering
in mobility model has been changed to avoid the non-monoticity in drain current
as a function of gate voltage.  Also the default value of parameter has been 
changed to 0. 

6) Bug fix : b4set.c

The default value for the model parameter VFB was missing. The default value of the
parameter VFB has ben now set to -1.0V in b4set.c
